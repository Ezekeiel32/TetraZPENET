# **App Name**: QuantumLeap

## Core Features:

- ZPE Simulation: Simulate zero-point energy by implementing ZPE flows in numpy/pytorch
- Quantum QPE Prototype: Implement pseudo-quantum circuit based on Qiskit/Cirq using custom ZPE and show scaled output
- Quantum Float System: Dynamically approximate the flow parameter instead of a float with leading zeroes before decimal shifts representing entangled probability. Each flow to has value in range [0.8-1.2]
- Model Configuration Support: Create easy model swapping in model architecture and analysis so other models of new architcture or settings can utilize 1+TB+ params for models for the same application.
- Quantum component targetting.: Employ tool to identify high gain components for targeted quantum application
- Adaptive Pertubation.: Adapt zero point energy from custom PyTorch component in Colab code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E479A) evoking high technology.
- Background color: Dark gray (#292933), promoting data readability.
- Accent color: Light blue (#A0D4F5), highlighting interactive parts.
- Clean, sans-serif font with monospaced elements where appropriate.
- Line-based, minimalist icons in the style of lucide.dev
- Dashboard-style layout with panels and modular components.
- Use subtle transitions for charts and numeric metrics.
